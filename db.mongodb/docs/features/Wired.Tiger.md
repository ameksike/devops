### WiredTiger Compression: Explanation and Related Questions

#### **What is WiredTiger Compression?**
WiredTiger Compression refers to the ability of the MongoDB WiredTiger storage engine to compress data and indexes to reduce storage space and improve Input/Output (I/O) efficiency. By applying compression algorithms to data stored both in-memory and on-disk, WiredTiger creates significant savings in terms of disk usage while optimizing database performance.

#### **How Does WiredTiger Compression Work?**
WiredTiger uses different compression algorithms, such as **Snappy**, **Zlib**, and **Zstd**, to compress data efficiently:
1. **Snappy Compression:**  
   - Default algorithm for WiredTiger.  
   - Optimized for speed, balancing compression levels and performance for frequent read/write workloads.  
   - Offers moderate disk savings and minimal CPU overhead.  

2. **Zlib Compression:**  
   - Provides higher compression ratios than Snappy, but requires higher CPU usage.  
   - Ideal for scenarios where saving disk space is critical, such as archiving cold data.  
   - Available starting in MongoDB **3.6**.  

3. **Zstd Compression:**  
   - Delivers even better compression ratios compared to Zlib.  
   - Best suited for reducing storage space drastically without significant performance degradation.  
   - Available starting in MongoDB **4.2**.

#### **Benefits Beyond Data Compression**
While data compression is the most notable benefit, WiredTiger offers additional advantages that make it the default choice for MongoDB deployments:

1. **Caching and Memory Management:**  
   WiredTiger employs a sophisticated caching mechanism to store frequently accessed data in memory. This reduces disk reads, accelerates query response times, and dynamically adjusts memory usage based on workloads (e.g., eviction and promotion techniques).

2. **Durability and Recovery:**  
   - WiredTiger ensures **commit-level and checkpoint-level durability**, meaning changes are regularly flushed from the cache to disk, protecting against data loss during system failures.  
   - WiredTiger’s support for **end-to-end checksums** helps verify data integrity, and salvage support enables recovery of corrupted data.

3. **Multi-Core Scalability:**  
   WiredTiger is designed to leverage modern CPUs efficiently. With lock-free algorithms, hazard pointers, and optimized messaging techniques, it ensures that workloads scale seamlessly across processors.

4. **Advanced Indexing:**  
   WiredTiger optimizes indexing structures, providing advanced options such as compound indexes and high-speed retrieval of data from large datasets.

#### **Is WiredTiger available by default, or does it need to be enabled?**
WiredTiger is the **default storage engine** for MongoDB starting from **version 3.2**. Users do not need to enable it—they can use WiredTiger compression and caching directly in new deployments as part of standard MongoDB configurations.

#### **WiredTiger Availability Across MongoDB Editions**
1. **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud):**  
   Fully supports WiredTiger as the default storage engine, including compression options (Snappy, Zlib, Zstd) and caching mechanisms. Advanced features like tuning and monitoring WiredTiger caching and compression are included.

2. **MongoDB Enterprise Advanced:**  
   Supports WiredTiger with additional enterprise-grade capabilities, such as integrated security features and advanced monitoring tools like Performance Advisor.

3. **MongoDB Community Edition:**  
   WiredTiger is available and enabled by default under MongoDB Community. Compression features (Snappy, Zlib, Zstd) are fully compatible, but enterprise-exclusive features such as advanced monitoring and managed services are not available.

### Answers to Additional Questions:

#### **What are the trade-offs when using WiredTiger compression?**
WiredTiger compression reduces storage costs and improves I/O efficiency, but it introduces potential CPU overhead due to the compression and decompression processes. These trade-offs need careful consideration:
- **For write-heavy workloads:** Use Snappy to minimize CPU overhead while maintaining acceptable compression levels.  
- **For archiving or rarely accessed "cold" datasets:** Use Zlib or Zstd, as these algorithms provide higher compression ratios despite increased CPU usage.

#### **What versions of MongoDB support WiredTiger compression?**
WiredTiger became MongoDB's default storage engine starting from **version 3.2**. Compression support evolved as follows:
- **MongoDB 3.2**: Introduced WiredTiger with Snappy compression by default.  
- **MongoDB 3.6**: Added support for Zlib compression.  
- **MongoDB 4.2**: Introduced Zstd, which provides the highest compression ratios.

### Considerations for Black Kite
For Black Kite’s DNS dataset, WiredTiger provides a tailored solution based on its compression capabilities:
- Use **Snappy** for frequently accessed "hot" data (recent data within the past 12 months). It provides balanced performance and compression, reducing both storage costs and latency.  
- Use **Zstd** for archived "cold" data (older than a year), leveraging MongoDB Atlas’s **Online Archive** feature to store this data more economically.

By using WiredTiger’s additional benefits like caching, scalability, and durability, Black Kite can handle its write-heavy (8,000 inserts/second) and query-intensive workload efficiently while maintaining cost-effective storage for its 20+ TB of data.

### Conclusion
MongoDB WiredTiger is optimized for scalability, reliability, and efficiency, making it a strong storage engine choice for demanding workloads like Black Kite's DNS ingestion project. In addition to compression, WiredTiger's caching mechanism, durability guarantees, multi-core scaling, and advanced indexing capabilities provide exceptional value across MongoDB Community Edition, MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, and Atlas.
