Based on the provided document and information about MongoDB and other databases, here's a detailed comparative table, focusing primarily on horizontal scaling techniques and how each system manages distributed data across clusters:

| Aspect                        | Oracle DB                                                              | MS SQL Server                                                          | PostgreSQL                                                             | MySQL                                                                 | MongoDB                                                              |

| **Horizontal Scaling Techniques** | **Oracle RAC**: RAC allows clustering across servers but is not true sharding. **GoldenGate** can aid with data distribution but mainly for replication. | **Federation**: Allows querying across distributed data sources. **Sharding**: Requires third-party solutions like Azure SQL Database Elastic Scale. | **Logical Partitioning**: Static partitioning of tables. Extensions like Citus add distributed capabilities but are not native. | **MySQL Cluster**: Offers NDB storage engine for sharding. **Vitess**: A powerful external framework for large scale. | **Built-in Sharding**: Automatically splits data across nodes in a cluster, offering true horizontal scaling without external tools. |
| **Replication**               | **Data Guard**: Provides high availability through replication, not primarily designed for scaling. | **Log Shipping/Replication**: Mainly for redundancy, not efficient for scaling. | **Streaming Replication**: Suitable for redundancy, logic needed for sharded replication. | **Master-Slave & Multi-Master**: Available, but sharding requires additional setup. | **Replica Sets**: Core feature; enables high availability with automatic failover, integral to distributed operations. |
| **Data Distribution**         | **Centralized Management**: RAC handles distributed transactions within a cluster but requires synchronization, not sharding. | **Querying Across Data**: Limited native support, third-party tools necessary for robust sharding. | **Extension-Based Distribution**: Third-party extensions like Citus aid distribution but require significant setup. | **Manual Configuration**: MySQL Cluster handles some distribution; Vitess dramatically enhances this with complex setups. | **Native Sharding**: Effortlessly distributes and balances data across shards in a cluster, central to MongoDB's architecture. |
| **Consistency Models**        | **Eventual Consistency**: Managed with sophisticated configurations; inherently central in sharded situations with external aid. | **Strong Consistency**: Default, but distributed models lean on eventual consistency via additional systems. | **Strong Consistency**: Defaults to single-node accounting; eventual consistency requires application-level configurations. | **Mixed Consistency**: Primarily strong, but MySQL Cluster allows eventual consistency adjustments. | **Tunable Consistency**: Customizable per operation; both strong and eventual consistency models supported natively. |
| **Performance Impact**        | **Complex with Scale**: Performance impacted by the complexity of distributed actions without native sharding capabilities. | **Enhanced Transactional Speed**: Strong in central setups, distributed models require external intervention, impacting efficiency. | **High Query Execution**: Effective single-node performance; distributed handling can compromise base efficiency. | **Transactionally High**: Sturdy single-node; efficient distributed models require external tuning via setups like Vitess. | **Optimized for Distribution**: High performance tailored for distributed setups, reducing load via shard balancing effectively. |

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Vertical Scaling**: All databases support vertical scaling, which means adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to the server. However, there are inherent limitations, especially in how much load they can handle before needing to scale horizontally.

- **Horizontal Scaling Techniques**: MongoDB is uniquely designed with built-in sharding that automatically distributes data across nodes, offering seamless horizontal scaling. Traditional RDBMSs like Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL require additional tools or complex configurations such as Oracle GoldenGate or Azure SQL Database Elastic Scale for horizontal scaling, making them inherently more complex and less integrated than MongoDB when it comes to native distributed capabilities.

- **Replication**: MongoDB's replica sets are integral, allowing data redundancy and high availability, supporting robust horizontal scaling capabilities. Other databases employ replication primarily for backups and disaster recovery, which is not optimized for scaling.

- **Data Distribution**: Unlike traditional databases, MongoDB's native support for sharding simplifies the data distribution, ensuring balanced loads across shards without requiring extra configuration, in contrast with databases that rely on third-party extensions.

- **Index Management**: All of these databases offer robust index options to optimize query performance. MongoDB uses B-tree indices and supports geospatial and full-text indices, but lacks some of the specialized indexing like bitmap indices found in Oracle.

- **Consistency Models**: MongoDB provides customizable consistency levels with both strong and eventual models available, supporting varied use cases in distributed environments. Traditional RDBMSs default to strong consistency and require complex setups for distributed systems, making this less flexible.

- **Performance Impact**: MongoDB's architecture is optimized for distributed operations, efficiently managing performance through native shard balancing. Traditional databases suffer from complexity-induced performance impacts when achieving desirable distribution scales, making MongoDB preferable for broadly distributed applications.

- **Data Types Supported**: MongoDB uses a flexible BSON format, allowing arrays and nested documents, which are naturally aligned with JSON types. The SQL databases offer a wider range of data types suitable for complex transactional and analytical operations.

- **Use Cases**: RDBMSs like Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL are extremely well-suited for structured data and complex transactional workloads. MongoDB excels in cases where flexible schema and rapid iteration are required, such as content-driven applications, IoT, and real-time analytics.

- **Limitations**: Each database has its specific limitations. MongoDB imposes a limit on document size, and requires careful resource management due to its memory-intensive nature, whereas traditional RDBMSs often run into limitations with horizontal scaling and may require additional licensing for advanced features.
The capabilities highlighted demonstrate how MongoDB's design caters directly to modern needs requiring scalable, flexible, and efficient database solutions for applications like real-time analytics and dynamic content management, contrasting with the robust but inherently centralized operations of traditional RDBMSs which need external reinforcement to achieve similar distribution.
