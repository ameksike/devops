Keycloak, being a widely used Identity and Access Management (IAM) system with Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities, can also be configured to send logs to stdout when deployed in a containerized environment like Kubernetes.

1. Logging Configuration for Keycloak in a Docker or Kubernetes Environment:
If you're running Keycloak using Docker or Kubernetes, it typically logs to stdout by default. However, you can explicitly configure it or ensure proper setup via environment variables in your deployment.

For Keycloak running on a WildFly server (its default application server), you can configure it to log to stdout by setting the following environment variables:

```yml
env:
- name: KEYCLOAK_LOGLEVEL
  value: INFO       # Sets the logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- name: WILDFLY_LOGGING_FILE
  value: stdout     # Sends logs to stdout
```

2. Helm Chart Configuration (Kubernetes Example):
If you're using Helm to deploy Keycloak, modify the values.yaml to ensure the logging is properly set:

```yml
extraEnv:
  - name: KEYCLOAK_LOGLEVEL
    value: INFO
  - name: WILDFLY_LOGGING_FILE
    value: stdout
```

This ensures that Keycloak outputs logs to stdout, making it compatible with Kubernetes' logging mechanisms.

For a self-hosted environment, [Keycloak](./README.md), [Gluu](../gluu.federation/README.md), or [FusionAuth](../fusion.auth/README.md) would be ideal choices, with Docker images readily available. If you want full control and customization, Keycloak remains one of the most versatile options with robust community support.
