PingFederate is an enterprise federation server that provides secure access and single sign-on (SSO) for users in cloud, mobile, and on-premises applications. It can be run in Docker containers to simplify deployment, scaling, and management.

### Environment Variables:

- PF_ADMIN_USER: Sets the PingFederate admin console username.
- PF_ADMIN_PASSWORD: Defines the PingFederate admin console password.
- PF_DEPLOYMENT_STATE: Defines the state of PingFederate on startup. Use RUNNING to ensure the server is ready after container initialization.
- PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA: Must be set to YES to accept PingIdentity's End User License Agreement.
- LICENSE_VERSION: Optional but sometimes required to specify the license version.
- PF_ENGINE_HOSTNAME: Defines the hostname for PingFederate’s engine. This can be adjusted based on the Docker network or orchestration settings.
- PF_ADMIN_PORT: The port where the PingFederate admin interface will be exposed (default is 9999).
- PF_ENGINE_PORT: The port for PingFederate’s runtime engine interface (default is 9031).


### Running PingFederate with Docker Compose:
- docker-compose up -d
- Access the PingFederate admin console by visiting:
    - http://localhost:9999
    - You can log in using the admin credentials you defined (PF_ADMIN_USER and PF_ADMIN_PASSWORD).

### Admin Configuration and Best Practices:
- Security:
    - Always set a strong password for the admin user.
    - Enable SSL for the PingFederate admin interface by configuring certificates, especially in production environments.

- Scaling:
    - PingFederate can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the engine service and connecting them to a load balancer.
    - In a production setting, the admin and engine services can be separated for better performance and isolation.

- Monitoring and Logging:
    - The logs are mapped to external volumes, making it easy to integrate with centralized logging systems (like ELK, Prometheus, or Grafana).
    - You can configure additional monitoring by exposing metrics through custom plugins.

- Backup and Restore:
    - The data volume in the docker-compose.yml holds all configuration files. Ensure that this directory is backed up regularly to avoid losing configurations during container restarts.

- Custom Configuration:
    - You can further extend this setup by adding support for custom certificates, advanced SSO configurations, or custom plugins. Place any custom configurations in the mapped data volume to ensure persistence across container restarts.
